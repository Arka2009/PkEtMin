# PkpMin1
Design Space Exploration and peak power minimization of malleable DAGs (with only chain like prec constraints) 
with hard execution time constraints and soft execution time constraints. 

1. The project is further split into two parts 
    a. HardPkpMin2 takes of hard execution time constraints, but for generalized DAG, check https://github.com/Arka2009/HardPkpMin2.git
    b. SoftPkpMin takes soft execution time constraints and is currently maintained in this repo.
